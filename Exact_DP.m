%% State Space Construction
% S: state_space
% Here we construct a matrix S whose rows contain all the possible combinations 
% of at most N objects on m places.
% To that aim, we use a routine base(m,N,n) which computes the representation of number
% n in the base N+1 over m figures, then we cancel the combinations of
% figures whose sum exceeds N
%

    if sum(s)<= N

%% In this subsection we find the value of the states at the terminal period
% for all the states

% Addition(s,C): It is a written function whose inputs are a state "s" and
% the price vector "C" e.g. Addition([1 2],[0.9 1.1]), which calculates the
% value of a state.

% Terminal_revenue: It is a variable to save the value function of each
% state at the terminal time step, its size is "NS(1,1)*(m+1)" ;
% each row has the e.g. [s,s*C'], "C'" denotes transpose of vector price
% "C".

n1=1;
while n1<= NS(1,1)

    Terminal_revenue(n1,1:(m+1),1)=[S(n1,1:end) Addition(S(n1,1:end),C)];

%% In this subsection we apply DP for each state and the entire horizon

% we use variable "a" as an index variable indicating a price "c_i".
% "k" is the time slot counter, k={0,1,...,T}.
% "Revenue" is the variable that saves the value function for each time
% slot "k", it is a 3 dimension matrix; also it saves the optimal decision 
% for each state 
% e.g. Revenue(1:NS,1:m+2,k), the row index points at a state, each row
% contains the corresponding state, Decision and optimal revenue,
% respectively.

%=============================

% This subsection is the main loop of DP
% we check whether or not each price is zero 
% loop on the variable "k={0,1,...,T}" represents the horizon which is the backward
% procedure; loop on variable "n1" denotes the index of state space that evaluate
% the policy for each state; loop on variable "a={1,2,...,m}" dentoes evaluation "m" 
% different prices for each state

%=====================

% stateanalysis(s,N,m,a): It is a function whose inputs are the state "s",
% the number of resources "N", number of prices "m", and an action "a=c_i"; whose
% output are possible transitions from a state if an action "a=c_i" has been taken;
% the other output is the probability of going from a state to other state by 
% taking an action "a=c_i", 
% e.g. [transition combined_probability]=stateanalysis([1 1],3,2,1)

%=====================
% 
% In DP we save the result as a look up table in the matrix "Revenue"
% "pair_finding": given a state at time slot "k", having possible
% "transitions", and "combined_probability", this function helps to find the 
% "Revenue" at the time slot "k+1" corersponding to each state "x(k+1)"
% based on "transition" matrix from matrix "Revenue".
% 
% possible_Revenue(1,a): It is a vector that saves the value fucntion for
% making an action "c_i=a" at each state, its size is 1*m i.e. at each state we evaluate "m"
% different policies and save them into this variable, the DP chooses the best
% policy from this vector for each state at each time step and inserts
% into the variable "Revenue"
